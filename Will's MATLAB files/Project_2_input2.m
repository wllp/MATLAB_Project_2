function varargout = Project_2_input2(varargin)
% PROJECT_2_INPUT2 MATLAB code for Project_2_input2.fig
%      PROJECT_2_INPUT2, by itself, creates a new PROJECT_2_INPUT2 or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = PROJECT_2_INPUT2 returns the handle to a new PROJECT_2_INPUT2 or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      PROJECT_2_INPUT2('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in PROJECT_2_INPUT2.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      PROJECT_2_INPUT2('Property','Value',...) creates a new PROJECT_2_INPUT2 or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before Project_2_input2_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to Project_2_input2_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
